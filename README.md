## General Information

This is my Digital Humanites project for my Digital Humanities course while studying at Pitt for my MLIS.
I combined the skills learned in my Data Science for Librarians course, web development skills from intro to Information technologies, and the tools I learned in this course to create this website.
I began using the boostrap layout that can still be found within the files in this GitHub repository.
In addition to the linking in these files, I included links in my footer on the website itself to all relevant sources.

Below I have included more information about the skills, tools, and background for each item.
Thank you for taking the time to view my work and I hope you have enjoyed this fun little project!
If you have any questions feel free to contact me, as this is for education I am more than happy to share or let people use what I have here!

## Website

The website is built off of a boostrap layout I downloaded from the internet.
I merely edited the stylesheets, and the html files to fit my needs.
I take no credit for the java scripting, and other more complex aspects of this website.
During the creation of the project I did create a second copy that I am experimenting with to learn these aspects of we development, but this is not seen here.

Here is a link to the bootsrap layout I started with: https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/stylish-portfolio/
I have moved their important documentation to the bootstrap Info folder so that I could maintain their readme and other files, while keeping the website I was editing simpler for my own sake.

## Jupyter Notebooks and Python

The Jupyter Notebooks I used were all done using skills I learned in my Data Science class.
I took these courses simultaneously and through consulting both instructors, I deemed it worth my while to attempt to combine the skills learned in these courses.
We learned both through reading texts, which I have linked below, and by trial and error.
I included all Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks folder in the repository, which should display on the GitHub page.

## Other DH tools

I will list the various DH tools used, or what other tools were used, for each data type within the project from top to bottom:

Animal Struck Count:
This was fairly simple data to show. Since it was more a list of data points that were given to me via a python script it was easiest to show as a table.
